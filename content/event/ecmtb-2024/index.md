summary: Organised a minisymposia and gave a talk at ECMTB 2024.
abstract: 'Political decisions are the epitome of how many aspects of our lives are determined by collective decision-making. However, active participation in collective decision-making is often highly
variable, with many individuals temporarily abstaining from voting in the face of uncertainty.
Whilst memory and noise have been found to aid consensus formation, the role of neutrality
in collective decision-making is not well understood, and the level of individual behavioural
complexity required for the emergence of group consensus is not well-characterised.
In this talk, I will show that symmetric autonomous systems with neutral intermediate
states, such as voters of a two-party system who can abstain, present only two possible dynamical pathways for consensus switching. I will also show how experiments with human participants helped us verify our predictions. The typical pathway observed in our experimental data
corresponds to an increase in the number of abstentions as the system transitions from one
state of consensus to the other, suggesting that they play a critical role in facilitating consensus
change by reducing the effective population size, making it more susceptible to fluctuations, as
opposed to what has been previously believed.
Our findings provide a parsimonious explanation of consensus formation and change, giving
insight into distributed decision-making protocols in animal and human collectives and suggesting efficient solutions to automated collective decision-making problems.
