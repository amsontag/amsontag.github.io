summary: Poster presented at the 12th ECMTB Conference (2022).
abstract: 'The effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as mask-wearing and social
distancing, as control measures for pandemic disease relies upon a conscientious and
well-informed public who are aware of and prepared to follow advice. Unfortunately, public
health messages can be undermined by competing misinformation and conspiracy theories,
spread virally through communities that are already distrustful of expert opinion. Models
for awareness spread are widely used in the literature to explore the effects of information
spread on epidemics through coupled feedback dynamics. In this talk, I will discuss the
results presented in our article [1], which investigates a simple model of the interaction
between disease spread and awareness dynamics in a heterogeneous population composed
of both trusting individuals who seek better quality information and will take precautionary
measures, and distrusting individuals who reject better quality information and have overall
riskier behaviour. We show that, as the density of the distrusting population increases,
the model passes through a phase transition to a state in which major outbreaks cannot
be suppressed. Our work highlights the urgent need for effective interventions to increase
trust and inform the public.
