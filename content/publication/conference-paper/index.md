abstract: The effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as
  mask-wearing and social distancing, as control measures for pandemic disease
  relies upon a conscientious and well-informed public who are aware of and
  prepared to follow advice. Unfortunately, public health messages can be
  undermined by competing misinformation and conspiracy theories, spread virally
  through communities that are already distrustful of expert opinion. In this
  article, we propose and analyse a simple model of the interaction between
  disease spread and awareness dynamics in a heterogeneous population composed
  of both trusting individuals who seek better quality information and will take
  precautionary measures, and distrusting individuals who reject better quality
  information and have overall riskier behaviour. We show that, as the density
  of the distrusting population increases, the model passes through a phase
  transition to a state in which major outbreaks cannot be suppressed. Our work
  highlights the urgent need for effective interventions to increase trust and
  inform the public.

summary: The effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as
  mask-wearing and social distancing, as control measures for pandemic disease
  relies upon a conscientious and well-informed public who are aware of and
  prepared to follow advice. Unfortunately, public health messages can be
  undermined by competing misinformation and conspiracy theories, spread virally
  through communities that are already distrustful of expert opinion. In this
  article, we propose and analyse a simple model of the inter-action between
  disease spread and awareness dynamics in a heterogeneous population composed
  of both trusting individuals who seek better quality information and will take
  precautionary measures, and distrusting individuals who reject better quality
  information and have overall riskier behaviour. We show that, as the density
  of the distrusting population increases, the model passes through a phase
  transition to a state in which major outbreaks cannot be suppressed. Our work
  highlights the urgent need for effective interventions to increase trust and
  inform the public.
