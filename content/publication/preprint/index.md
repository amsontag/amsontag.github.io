title: Stochastic drift in discrete waves of non-locally interacting-particles
abstract: In this paper, we investigate a generalised model of N particles
  undergoing second-order non-local interactions on a lattice. Our results have
  applications across many research areas, including the modelling of migration,
  information dynamics and Muller's ratchet -- the irreversible accumulation of
  deleterious mutations in an evolving population. Strikingly, numerical
  simulations of the model are observed to deviate significantly from its
  mean-field approximation even for large population sizes. We show that the
  disagreement between deterministic and stochastic solutions stems from
  finite-size effects that change propagation speed and cause the position of
  the wave to fluctuate. These effects are shown to decay anomalously as $(\log
  N)^2$ and $(\log N)^3$, respectively -- much slower than the usual $\sqrt{N}$
  factor. As a result, the accumulation of deleterious mutations in a Muller's
  ratchet and the loss of awareness in a population are processes that occur
  much faster than predicted by the corresponding deterministic models. The
  general applicability of our model suggests that this unexpected scaling could
  be important in a wide range of real-world applications.
