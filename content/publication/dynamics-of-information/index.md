title: Dynamics of information networks
abstract: "We explore a simple model of network dynamics which has previously been applied to the study of information flow in the context of epidemic spreading. A random rooted network is constructed that evolves according to the following rule: at a constant rate, pairs of nodes (i, j) are randomly chosen to interact, with an edge drawn from i to j (and any other out-edge from i deleted) if j is strictly closer to the root with respect to graph distance. We characterise the dynamics of this random network in the limit of large size, showing that it instantaneously forms a tree with long branches that immediately collapse to depth two, then it slowly rearranges itself to a star-like configuration. This curious behaviour has consequences for the study of the epidemic models in which this information network was first proposed."
