Over 7 years of research experience, leveraging data analysis and high-performance computation to develop stochastic models of complex real-world systems. Notably, developed methods to derive underlying stochastic differential equations from multidimensional data sets. Proficient in Python, C++, MATLAB and R. A team-worker and highly motivated to drive insights and innovation at the intersection of mathematics, data science, and quantitative research.

Before joining cohort 7 in the SAMBa CDT, I did an M.Sc. in Physics at the São Paulo State University (UNESP) and a B.Sc. in Physics at the University of São Paulo (USP).

Outside academia, I enjoy reading books, hiking and learning new languages.
